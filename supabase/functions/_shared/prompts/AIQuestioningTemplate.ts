‚Ä¢ Ask "Is it [SPECIFIC ITEM]?" questions

- "Does it have unique features?"
- "Is it from a specific region or time period?"
- "Does it have multiple forms or variations?"
- "Are there any notable aspects?"
- "Is it known for particular qualities?"

- Basic properties everyone knows: "Are they male?", "Are they still alive?"
- Concrete time periods: "Did they serve before 1990?", "Were they active in the 2000s?"
- Specific locations: "Are they from Asia?", "Did they lead the United States?"
- Clear yes/no facts: "Were they a president?", "Did they win a war?"
