STEP 1: REVIEW CONFIRMED FACTS
- List all YES answers from previous questions
- List all NO answers from previous questions  
- What do these facts tell me about the remaining possibilities?

STEP 2: DOMAIN COHERENCE CHECK
- Am I staying strictly within the ${this.getCategoryName()} category boundaries?
- Are all my remaining possibilities actually ${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase()}?
- Have I eliminated any impossible combinations?
- Am I building logically on confirmed facts without contradiction?

STEP 3: IDENTIFY REMAINING POSSIBILITIES
- Based on ALL confirmed facts, what specific items could still match?
- How many possibilities roughly remain after applying all constraints?
- What sub-category within ${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase()} am I focusing on?

STEP 4: OPTIMAL ELIMINATION STRATEGY  
- Which single property would best split my remaining possibilities roughly in half?
- What concrete, specific question would eliminate ~50% while being easily answerable?
- Does this question lead toward a logical conclusion path?

STEP 5: RIGOROUS SEMANTIC DUPLICATION CHECK
- Have I asked anything semantically similar using different words?
- Would my proposed question be equivalent to any previous question if rephrased?
- Am I asking about something I can already deduce from existing confirmed answers?
- Is this question fundamentally different from all ${alreadyAskedQuestions.length} previous questions?

🔍 SEMANTIC SIMILARITY SELF-CHECK:
Before finalizing your question, ask yourself:
1. ✅ SYNONYM CHECK: Am I using different words for the same concept?
   - Example: "big" vs "large", "from Europe" vs "European"
2. ✅ GRAMMAR CHECK: Am I rephrasing a previous question?
   - Example: "Were they president?" vs "Did they serve as president?"
3. ✅ CONCEPT CHECK: Am I asking about the same underlying concept?
   - Example: "electronic" vs "uses electricity", "carnivorous" vs "eats meat"
4. ✅ CATEGORY CONSTRAINT CHECK: Does this violate any category boundaries?
   - Stay within ${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase()} category limits

${this.getCategorySpecificContaminationPrevention()}

DOMAIN NARROWING ANALYSIS & COHERENCE ENFORCEMENT:
- Which sub-domain within ${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase()} am I focusing on?
- What are the defining constraints of this sub-category?
- Which properties are mandatory vs optional for items in this sub-category?
- How can I use these constraints to eliminate impossible options?
- The domain space remains within ${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase()} boundaries
- Stay within the established domain without violating category constraints

MANDATORY DOMAIN COHERENCE REQUIREMENTS:
${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase() === 'animals' ? `
• ALL remaining possibilities MUST be animals (biological organisms)
• ALL questions MUST relate to: classification, habitat, diet, physical features, behavior, size
• ELIMINATED DOMAINS: objects (technology, materials), people (demographics, careers)
• SUB-DOMAIN EXAMPLES: "large African mammals", "small domesticated pets", "aquatic vertebrates"
• COHERENCE CHECK: Can I name 3-5 specific animals that match all confirmed facts?` : ''}

${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase() === 'objects' ? `
• ALL remaining possibilities MUST be physical objects (man-made or natural things)
• ALL questions MUST relate to: material, size, function, location, technology, purpose
• ELIMINATED DOMAINS: animals (biology), people (human attributes)
• SUB-DOMAIN EXAMPLES: "electronic handheld devices", "kitchen utensils", "wooden furniture"
• COHERENCE CHECK: Can I name 3-5 specific objects that match all confirmed facts?` : ''}

${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase().includes('leaders') || this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase().includes('players') ? `
• ALL remaining possibilities MUST be people (human individuals)
• ALL questions MUST relate to: demographics, geography, career, achievements, time periods
• ELIMINATED DOMAINS: objects (physical things), animals (biological organisms)
• SUB-DOMAIN EXAMPLES: "20th century European leaders", "retired NFL quarterbacks", "modern Asian leaders"
• COHERENCE CHECK: Can I name 3-5 specific people that match all confirmed facts?` : ''}

STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC REMAINING POSSIBILITIES ANALYSIS  
- Given ALL confirmed facts, list 5-10 specific items that could still match
- How many possibilities roughly remain after applying all constraints?
- Are there any obvious subcategories within my remaining options?

STEP 3: OPTIMAL ELIMINATION STRATEGY
- Which single property would best split my remaining possibilities roughly in half?
- What concrete, specific question would eliminate ~50% while being easily answerable?
- How can I target the largest remaining uncertainty to gain maximum information?
- Does this question lead toward a logical conclusion path?

STEP 4: RIGOROUS REPETITION & REDUNDANCY CHECK
- Have I asked anything semantically similar to my proposed question using different words?
- Am I asking about something I can already deduce from existing confirmed answers?
- Is this question fundamentally different from all ${alreadyAskedQuestions.length} previous questions?
- Does my question violate any of the forbidden patterns above?

🚨 SEMANTIC DUPLICATION PREVENTION - TRIPLE CHECK:
Compare your proposed question against these patterns:
• SYNONYMS: "big/large/huge", "electronic/digital", "from X/X-nationality"
• CONCEPTS: "eat meat/carnivorous/predator", "use electricity/battery-powered"
• GRAMMAR: "Were they X?/Did they serve as X?", "Are they X?/Do they come from X?"
• ACTIVE/PASSIVE: "served as president/was president", "elected by people/democratically elected"

STEP 5: RIGOROUS QUESTION VALIDATION & CONTRADICTION PREVENTION
- Is my question concrete and specific (not vague like "unique characteristics")?
- Can most people answer this definitively with yes/no (no specialized knowledge required)?
- Does this add meaningful new information that cannot be deduced?
- Does this question follow the optimal progression strategy for this category?
- Will this question help me reach the correct answer faster?

CRITICAL CONTRADICTION CHECKS - MANDATORY BEFORE ASKING:
1. ✅ LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY CHECK: Does this contradict any confirmed YES answers?
   - Ensure your question doesn't contradict already confirmed facts

2. ✅ DEDUCTION VIOLATION CHECK: Am I asking about something I already know?
   - Don't ask about properties that are logical consequences of confirmed facts

3. ✅ SEMANTIC DUPLICATION CHECK: Is this a rephrasing of a previous question?
   - Avoid asking the same concept using different words

4. ✅ CATEGORY BOUNDARY CHECK: Does this violate category constraints?

🚨 CRITICAL CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT - THESE QUESTIONS ARE FORBIDDEN:
${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase() === 'animals' ? `
ANIMALS ONLY - NO questions about:
• Human attributes: "Do they have awards?", "Do they have a job?", "Are they married?"
• Object properties: "Are they electronic?", "Are they made of plastic?", "Do they need batteries?"
• Impossible for animals: "Are they alive?" (redundant - all animals are alive)
ANIMALS ONLY - ASK about: species, habitat, diet, size, behavior, domestication, classification
` : ''}${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase() === 'objects' ? `
OBJECTS ONLY - NO questions about:
• Biological attributes: "Are they alive?", "Do they breathe?", "Do they have babies?"
• Human attributes: "Are they male?", "Do they have a job?", "Do they have awards?"
• Animal behaviors: "Do they hunt?", "Are they wild?", "Do they migrate?"
OBJECTS ONLY - ASK about: material, size, function, technology, purpose, location, cost
` : ''}${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase().includes('leaders') || this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase().includes('players') ? `
PEOPLE ONLY - NO questions about:
• Animal biology: "Do they hibernate?", "Are they carnivorous?", "Do they have fur?"
• Object properties: "Are they made of metal?", "Do they need batteries?", "Are they electronic?"
• Basic biology: "Are they alive?" (redundant - all people are alive)
PEOPLE ONLY - ASK about: demographics, geography, profession, achievements, time periods
` : ''}
   - Stay strictly within ${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase()} category boundaries

STEP 6: FINAL QUESTION SELECTION
- Based on the analysis above, what is the single best question to ask next?
- Does it satisfy all validation criteria and avoid all forbidden patterns?
- Will it lead me closer to identifying the specific item within ${this.getCategoryName().toLowerCase()}?

CRITICAL: Work through ALL these steps systematically before asking your question!`
